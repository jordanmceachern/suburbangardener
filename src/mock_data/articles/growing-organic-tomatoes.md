# The Complete Guide to Growing Organic Tomatoes

_Published on August 15, 2024 by Sarah Mitchell_

Growing organic tomatoes is one of the most rewarding experiences for any gardener, but it's definitely not a beginner's crop. These beautiful, flavorful fruits require patience, attention, and the right approach to truly thrive in your garden.

## Understanding Tomato Types

Before you start, it's crucial to understand the two main types of tomatoes you can grow:

**Determinate Tomatoes** are bush-like plants that produce all their fruit at once, typically reaching 5-6 feet in height. These are perfect if you want to make sauces, paste, or salsa, as you'll get a large harvest all at the same time.

**Indeterminate Tomatoes** are vining plants that continue producing fruit throughout the growing season until the first frost. These can grow 10-15 feet long and provide a steady harvest of fresh tomatoes perfect for daily eating.

## Top Varieties to Consider

For beginners, I recommend starting with these proven varieties:

- **Sungold**: Golden orange cherry tomatoes that are incredibly prolific
- **Juliet**: Small, red grape tomatoes with exceptional flavor
- **Black Cherry**: Stunning dark purple heirloom cherry tomatoes

All three are indeterminate varieties that will give you continuous harvests throughout the season.

## Timing Your Tomato Growing Season

Tomatoes need warm weather and 8-10 hours of sunlight daily. The key is timing your planting correctly:

- Start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before your last frost date
- Transplant outdoors only after all danger of frost has passed
- Expect 65-90 days from transplant to first harvest

In colder climates, you'll have one growing season during summer months. Warmer regions can often grow two crops - one in spring and another in fall.

## Planting and Supporting Your Tomatoes

When transplanting, bury your tomato plant deeper than usual - cover the first set of leaves with soil. This encourages strong root development that will support the heavy fruit load later.

Proper support is essential. Skip the traditional tomato cages - they're too small and make maintenance difficult. Instead, consider:

- **Trellises**: Perfect for vining varieties, allowing easy access for pruning and harvesting
- **Florida Weave**: Great for multiple plants in a row using stakes and twine
- **Arch Trellises**: Beautiful and functional, maximizing vertical growing space

## Essential Care Requirements

**Fertilizing**: Tomatoes are heavy feeders. Use nitrogen-rich fertilizer early for strong growth, then switch to phosphorus-rich options when flowering begins.

**Pruning**: Weekly pruning is crucial. Remove unhealthy leaves, select one main stem, and prune lower branches after the first flowers appear. Never remove more than one-third of the plant at once.

**Watering**: Provide consistent, deep watering - at least one inch per week. Water at soil level, not on leaves, and maintain consistency to prevent fruit cracking.

**Pest Protection**: Keep your garden clean, use companion planting with basil, marigolds, and herbs, and consider garden mesh for organic pest control.

## Harvesting Your Reward

After 2-3 months of care, you'll start harvesting. Use clean pruners to cut stems above the fruit. For best flavor, let tomatoes ripen on the vine until they begin changing color from the bottom up.

If frost threatens or animals are stealing your harvest, pick tomatoes when they start blushing yellow and ripen them indoors in a paper bag or on a windowsill.

With proper care, expect around 100 tomatoes from each plant during peak season. The wait is long, but vine-ripened, homegrown tomatoes are absolutely worth the effort - there's simply nothing like that first perfect bite of summer.
